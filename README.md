# 🛡️ Cyber Safe – Phishing Detection and Web Safety Browser Extension

Cyber Safe is a lightweight, cross-browser extension designed to protect users from phishing attacks in real time. By using the Google Safe Browsing API and SSL/TLS certificate validation, the extension identifies malicious or suspicious websites and immediately notifies users with a clear, easy-to-understand pop-up alert.

- Scanning the active tab's URL.
- Verifying SSL/TLS certificates.
- Cross-checking against Google Safe Browsing API.
- Instantly notifying users about suspicious websites.
- Promoting awareness through safe browsing tips.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **URL Fetching**: Captures the current URL of the active tab.
2. **Verification**:
   - Checks the URL against Google's Safe Browsing database.
   - Verifies the site’s SSL/TLS certificate.
3. **Alert Mechanism**:
   - If a site is flagged as malicious or has an invalid certificate, a warning pop-up is shown.
   - Safe websites get a green status message for user reassurance.

## 🧪 Security Measures
